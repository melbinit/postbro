    "transcript": "Abortion. Abortion. What is it? I don't know. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. No. Oh my god. They found the camera. This is me and these are my grandparents. And well, they have no idea what's about to happen. Really smell something dead or something. Here's the plan. Operation: Give Granny a heart attack. I'll secretly move into their house for as many days as possible without getting caught. Set up cameras, set up pranks, and make them think they're going crazy. And just when they're about to lose their minds, I pop out and I'll surprise them. Why? Because they miss me. And I miss them. I live in NYC, and they live all the way across the country in my hometown in the Bay Area. They're always begging me to come visit. And well, I'm just going to do what they told me to do. I'm here at our first stop in the Bay Area on top of my bus that I haven't used in a while and it's been rotting at my parents place. So, I'm here to ask my parents how to get into my grandparents house. Unlike my past adventures, like living in my friend's closet or sneaking into my parents house, I have absolutely no idea how to get into my grandparents, especially because I know they have an alarm system, which is going to be difficult. Hello, Dad. What's happening, man? You're the man of the hour. You're my inside guy. Okay, you do. The real question is, do you have a key to their house? I do. Oh, yes. I'm It's been years since I've used it. Their alarm, you know, they have an alarm. Their alarm is always on. I just need to get into their house. Then I'm good. Do you know CPR? If you What? What if they have a heart attack? They're 87. I wonder if they even saw that your our vid the video. And now with my dad's help, we decided to ask my grandparents out for some dessert. Something they can't resist. Hello. Hey. Hey. Hey. Because we were gonna invite you out to pick up some dessert or something with you. It's fine. I mean, you know, we're free. Okay. Well, sounds good. Bring bring dessert here. All right. That'll be perfect. See you guys in a while. Okay. Talk to you later. Thanks. Bye. Nice. That was funny. Nana goes, \"No, please bring the dessert.\" I am nice. She don't want to leave. She don't want to leave. With the plan locked in, it was go time. And at this point, I was getting very nervous. Okay, I had my last meal. We are now heading over to Nana and Papa's. This is going to be the This is going to be the hardest one yet. Oh my god, I need to take a poop so badly now, too. This is the worst timing. You go to the bathroom first. All right. See if you can get to the garage. See if you can get Kelly in. Okay, we got this. Okay. Okay, let's see. Here we go. Operation: Give granny a heart attack is in full effect. So, while my parents met with my grandparents, I snuck through the side door where I waited patiently for my mom to let me in to hopefully bypass the alarm. At least I thought. Dead ass. [Music] Thank you. Actually, I'm in. I can hear Papa set the alarm while they're leaving. Okay, I don't hear anybody, so I I think they left. Let's go. Oh, baby. We are in system armed all zone secure. This is like breaking into a prison. Okay, let's see if we can find a place. Oh Oh Oh And just like that, as soon as the mission had started, it ended. Is what I would have said if my dad didn't give me the security code. Thanks, Dad. Holy It is totally motion sensored. Where the hell is the motion sensor? Okay, well, I turned it off, so it should be good now. This is my grandparents room. And this is a spare bedroom. I'm gonna set up camp here. Okay, if I can sleep, it would have to be in here. Oh my god. Oh my god. This thing is stacked to the brim. I don't really have any options. So, this is really This has got to do. We don't have time. We need to go. We need to set up cameras right now. Holy bro. I'm in like a James Bond movie. This is so intense to me. I'm actually shaking. Hopefully, they just don't notice that camera. One done. This is my grandpa's office. And I think I can hide one in here, too. Right there. You'll see how clean their house is. I mean, look at this goddamn kitchen. It's so clean and neat. And everything's black. And these are all white. God damn it. Here's the camera. This one's pretty good. A lot of these cameras are going to have to be out in the open. And I'm just going to have to pray that they're just not going to be that attentive, which I don't really think they will. Bro, I might be so cooked. All the security cameras have pretty much been set up. There's one other one, but I don't want to get too greedy. So, let's set up some pranks. Earlier today, I went to Petco and I picked up a dead rat. I'm going to place it towards the kitchen area. And I also brought fart spray. Absolutely criminal. Because we have a security camera right here. I'm going to place the rat behind the TV. Oh god. Oh god, it's dead. A little bit of fart spray. Oh god, that smells so bad. So earlier I used AI. I pretty much AIDed my grandparents in different scenarios that have never happened. I showed my parents man and pop out a rave. I'm just going to put it on this goddamn wall. This one I think looks the most real of them making a fire, but it's so random. It's going to have a picture of them and Captain America. Much better. Oh my god, it's It smells actually so bad, bro. I'm sorry. I'm I'm already sorry in advance. All the pranks are set. I reset the alarm. I got to make it through this first night. My goal is to spend at least two nights. I mean, it's really easy to get caught, especially in a small house. Come on, lights out. Okay, they're about to be home. Let's see. Let's see how long I last. I noticed that. Oh my god, they definitely smell it. I definitely thought they would keep investigating the smell, but apparently my nana wanted to investigate something else. Oh [Music] [Music] That was crazy close. I'm slightly visible from outside and Nana did not see me. That was so sketch. I'm actually sweating right now. Holy Jeez, it really smells. But what is it? I don't know. Something dead or something. Doesn't smell like anything yet. They're not looking in the right spot, though. My grandparents are definitely going to bed. Let's drink some water. If I need to pee, I'm cooked. I only have one water bottle. So, in order to pee, I need to finish this entire thing or I just need to contaminate the water. But that would suck. They are definitely asleep by now. My biggest concern going forward is that Nana is going to come into this closet again to get more shoes in the morning when she leaves. And so I need to be up before she comes because I'll be sprawled out like laying down. It was such a close call this time. So Nana and Papa had probably been asleep for hours at this point. So I thought it was a perfect time for a night mission. We out here in the night. I can't see anything. Oh, little late night snack. Should we get a little late night snack? Oh crap. I forgot the light turns on.  Every time I'd come to my grandparents, I'd eat a slice of this. It's so yummy. So, this is some lasagna. It looks kind of sussy. If this thing is hella moldy, I'm cooked. I don't want to get too comfortable. So, I am going to bed. Good morning. It's 6:30 in the morning. That was one of the most uncomfortable sleeps I've ever had. I mean, I'm just sleeping on top of shoes, but it I guess it could be worse. I don't know what would be worse. It's not even bright outside yet, but I've taken no chances. I'm in position. They're awake. I can hear them. Time to get quiet. [Music] That was crazy close. Literally was like 1 ft away from me. And now the fact that this happened twice already is actually really concerning. So we might need to switch things up. Well, something around here. What would it be? with paws. No, my grandparents are in the kitchen. What are coolants? Pants. Yeah, but it was like like this. These pants cut. Oh, it's kind of like watching Animal Planet in a sense. I'm so glad I kept this this My grandparents are just on their phone. They're just sipping coffee, eating breakfast, and the rat is right next to them. I got to pee. I got to take this opportunity and I got to pee. I'm going to use this bottle I have. I'm ruining my water supply because I haven't drank all the water yet. But I have to go so badly. Like I just have to Oh yeah. Oh no, it's full. God damn it. I just pissed myself. That's awesome. I'm taking my purse cuz I don't need it. Okay. Have a good one. Papa is in his office. I can hear him. He's on the phone. Is this policy still in effect? I'm just going to go out. I think he's going to be okay. I feel like he's just going to stay there. Yeah. Let's go. We outside. We outside. We outside. Ghost is clear. Medical. I want to show you guys something. This entire time, every time Nana's come in and almost got me, she hasn't noticed a few items that I snuck in. There is a new Do It Excites collection. Okay, so here we have the first ever Do It Excites colored long sleeve t-shirt. It's got this really nice embroidery. It's got this nice sun design. I think this type of shirt is only for like real clothing brands. So, I'm just excited to have something like this for Do It Excites. Also, before I show you the rest of the collection, I got to give a big thanks to Shopify. Shopify is pretty much how I run my entire Do It Excites clothing business. It's a powerful set of tools to start or manage your business, whether it's online or in person. Yeah. Okay, perfect. Okay, so this new piece is insane. This design is like a fast blurry motion vibe to it, and I'm honestly just obsessed how it turned out. And for the first time ever, we dropped it in a thermal. It's like a cozy waffle type material, and it's perfect for the winter. And honestly, when I throw it on, it just feels premium. But you probably thought I'd stop there. It comes in a hoodie, and it comes in a t-shirt. So now you can get the whole set. Oh wow. Oh. When I first started Do Excites, it was my first ever company I've ever built. I had no idea where to start. And as I was doing research, I came across Shopify. And I built my entire website on Shopify. And I've really used their tools to help grow and build do what excites to what it is today. I don't really do that many drops cuz I want to keep it fresh and I want to keep it premium. So, I went on Shopify and I used their new AI assistant, Sidekick, and pretty much it told us we've done over 13,000 orders, which is insane. It's just crazy to me because Do Excites came from such a personal spot in my life. And now to see so many people resonate with the brand and the messaging is just like so heartwarming to me. And finally, I know I already showed you this design, but we have the brown trucker hat and this perfect oversized crop brown t-shirt. It's honestly my favorite t-shirt we've ever made. It's just like super comfortable and in my opinion very stylish as well. Holy crap. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. He stepped so loudly. Oh my god. Dude, my adrenaline is going. I'm getting a little concerned that Papa's going to hear me, but it was 100% worth it to show you guys the new collection and tell you how cool Shopify is. If you are thinking about starting a business or if you already have a business, I cannot recommend Shopify more.

I just overheard Papa and Nana's conversation on the phone. that is done with her haircut and in about 1 hour they're going to be leaving for lunch and I was talking to my parents and I know where they're going and that's about 40 minutes away. I am just going to stay in the closet until then. Nana is back. Hopefully she doesn't come to the closet again. So I'm watching Nana on the security camera. In my entire life when I've been in her house, she's never let me have my shoes on. I caught her redhanded. I got you, Nana. Get caught. Oh my god, they found the camera. They totally found my camera. Oh my god, my cover might be blown. My cover might be blown. I hear their car started. And now I think they're leaving. Let's go. Let's go. up. Oh yeah, baby. I want to confirm they're gone first. [Music] [Applause] Oh my god, they're gone. Oh my god. [Music] [Music] Hallelujah. Well, well, well. We're surviving. Let's go. Oh, this is so good. Oh, this feels so good. I have a few things I want to get done. I want to move places. I need to eat. I need to set up more pranks. But before I do any of that, I need to tell you a little bit more about Nana and Papa. Nana and Papa, Arlene and Mitch, they're honestly like the nucleus of the Wakasa family. They brought us on so many trips. We've gone all around the world together, and one of their favorite things in the entire world is money. They really instilled that on us. My grandpa's favorite saying is, \"A penny saved is a penny earned.\" And when I was little, Nana got me fat. She didn't believe me the first time I told her that. You remember when I was fat? Fat? You were never fat. Exhibit A. I guess you were. Okay. She didn't really make me fat. Anyways, they're just the nicest people ever. They're always open arms to my friends or my girlfriend. They are both born in America and two generations later they got me. So, they should be really proud of themselves. Like, I'm sleeping in closets and stuff for fun. This is where I was originally sleeping right there. But I need to move. This is my grandpa's office. And this is his closet. And since I've been here, he's never opened it. And so, this is home sweet home. Bon appetite. Breakfast is served. Oh yes. Thanks for the fruit, guys. Mhm. It's now time to take the pranks to the next level. Let's be honest, they're on to me. So, we might as well have a little bit more fun with it. So, Papa spends most of his time at his chair looking at his screen. But what's right next to his screen? Oh, yeah. This picture that we're going to change. He's sitting here at the desk. It's right there. Cuz of course, Papa won't notice a picture of him shaking hands with Barack Obama. This photo I placed on Papa's desk, I just don't think he's going to see it. So, I decided to move it all the way to the front door. I don't think they're going to miss this one. All right, let's move this guy. Oh god. Okay, they got to see that now. Come on. They're going to see that. They're going to see that. God. Okay. Well, this camera, this camera that I replugged in, I'm just going to leave here because if I don't, then they might never discover the rat and then I don't have footage of that. Imagine they find the rat and we don't get footage of that. Like, that's that's terrible. Oh, yeah. We are good tonight. Didn't get to do this last night. That's Oh Oh Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Okay. Okay. Okay. Here we go. Come on, let's get in there. See you. So much better than the last closet. I think Nana and Pop are just chilling in the car or something. I don't know. But I want to show you something that I stole. Ah, another DC. It's not an IVL, but they don't have an espresso maker. So, [Music] I think that Diet Coke got me going. They're home. It's a huge rack in our house. It's dead. No wonder it smell. Oh yeah. Oh god. What was it living all this time? Sorry, Nana. Are you going to put gloves on? I got paper. It's cute. You want a bag? Now we're going to see if they remember about the camera because I replugged it in for weeks. I've seen droppings. Yeah. Nana literally goes for weeks I've been seeing droppings. No babies there. Now they're vacuuming. Now I feel bad. I feel bad. Now Papa's being put to work. [Music] Nana is so funny. She sees the picture, which is a picture of her and Captain America, and goes, \"Oh.\" And then just moves the picture. So funny. That's it. Is she calling the police? Is she calling the police? Hi, welcome home. Okay, she's just calling her friend. I swear I only heard her dial three times. We lost the kitchen angle again. I think Papa unplugged it. He's on to me. And after the scare of both thinking Nana was calling the police and Papa once again finding the camera, Papa decided to do something we've yet to see him do. As soon as I moved in here, he's finally looking into the closet. And at this point, I'm thinking, this could be it. This journey was literally flashing before my eyes. After all the time setting up the cameras, the pranks, after all the close calls with Nana in her closet, I sat inside Papa's closet frozen, hoping he wouldn't notice me. But as he looked for something in his closet, he started caressing my legs. And I kid you not, it went on for what felt like hours. He pretty much was giving me a massage at this point. But finally, he moved on from my legs and this happened. Oh my god, he's scared. You really Wait a minute. What dead grandchild is going to be in my closet? Come on. Wait. Wait. We p the lava. Where's Ashley? That's the first thing you asked me. But how long were you hiding? Since yesterday. No. Yeah. Here. I love that you felt my legs and you didn't say anything. Oh, you know what I said? This is warm. This is really strange. When Anna's done with her call, I'll surprise her. Okay. So, don't say anything. Okay. relax you. I'm going to just get some. Okay. Papa was literally grabbing my legs for like a whole 2 minutes straight, like feeling my legs in my toes and stuff. Well, yeah, my cover was blown, but Nana still didn't know I was there. And with Papa's help, there was still time to execute operation give Nana a heart attack. [Laughter] Oh my god. I'm sorry. You're okay. My heart. No, I'm Hello. Oh my god. Oh my god. I'm fine. Are you here by yourself? I've actually Where's Ashley? I've been here since yesterday. I can't believe it. The rat. Did you put it there? Oh my god. Dies. Dies. Kelly has been living in our house and I never even knew it. You could have been all day. Yes. God. Why don't you say so? We're going to have breakfast with you. God. No. Look at this. It's plugged in. This is a camera. That's what we saw. Do you see that? The speaker. Oh, we said, \"Oh, it must be something Michael gave us.\" You saw this, man. I saw you saw this. Yeah. I said, \"What is Wait a minute. I never met Captain America.\" Yeah. Oh, we've never been to a rave party. Wait, don't we know? No, we don't. I like think it's real. Look, I see it. Oh, all right. Because I need to I need to repay the favor because obviously I gave you guys a little scare. Yes. I got us tickets to the Warriors game. Oh, single game tickets. How great. How nice. Oh, how great. It's the first game of the season. Oh, wow. That should be Kelly. That is Thank you. Of course. Of course. I love that. That is it was it was well worth everything we went through for the tickets that were excited. I didn't last as long as I had hoped. Yeah, papa. But honestly, there's no better reward than getting to spend time with my grandparents. The older I get, the more I realize how fragile these moments are. All right, Nana, how's the game going? Terrific. How each second I get to spend with them is the real prize. There's so much excitement and great seats. Kiss cat because time flies. Before you know it, you've grown up looking back wishing you could just go back to the beginning. [Music] Ah. Oh, that is classic.",
